## Introduction

In your inbox, see an icon by email addresses to indicate whether they are familiar or not. This can help reduce security problems like phishing by reminding you to reconsider unfamiliar emails from email addresses. You can mark individual emails as familiar, or many with the * wildcard. Thus, you can use patterns like \*@example.com or \*@\*.example.com to mark many email addresses as familiar.
